This html file was created with Chat gpt.  The prompts were below:

I need a little application in js and css that shows an animation of a ball launched at any angle from 0 to 90 degrees. It needs to be shown on an x y axis of meters. Show the ball's route or trajectory too from launch till is reaches the ground (a parabola) ignore air friction. Note that acceleration due to gravity is 9.81ms2. I need to be able to choose angle of launch. Always model this so that when it hits the ground its 9 seconds, so chose an appropriate launch speed. Also mark points along the trajectory at 1,3,5 seconds and lastly 9 seconds. The entire ball route should fit on the screen. Make it to a scale that fits on the screen
